# Peer-to-Peer Car Sharing System
* The Peer to Peer car sharing is used to design a decentralized car-sharing scheme is important for solving the centralized problem. 
* This scheme provides a secure platform for the both driver and rider to avoid some security issues.
* The key novelty is introduced in the dApp service, which reflects a decrease in costs and an increase in data transparency in that system.
To this end, we proposed a decentralized car-sharing scheme by using blockchain and smart contracts.
* Database:
* Firebase: Information about registering and logging users is stored in the Firebase database.

8* Ethereum Tool :https://metamask.io/
MetaMask: It is a browser extension that allows users to manage their Ethereum accounts, and interact with decentralized applications.

* Ganache:https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/ It provides pre-funded test accounts that can be used to add dummy ethers to Metamask for transactions.

* **RESULTS:**
* **1 Dashboard**

* **2 Driver And Rider Authenticaton**


* **Request for Ride and Confirm Ride**


* **Paymnet Confirmation**
